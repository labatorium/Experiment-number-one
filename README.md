Experimental repository

Prospective build of a GIT repository for use as a colaborative creative writing tool. Investigating GIT's potential (or lack) for use as such a tool.

First design:
character and scene text - overview / list of current characters and scenes.
character and scene notes folders - contain detailed thumbnail scketches of characters and scenes respectivly.

Pieces folder contains scenes with characters in them, the actual piece of creative writing which forms a piece of the story.
